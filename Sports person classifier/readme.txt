In the model folder, there is folder called Dataset. There should be all the images I've used to train the ultimate model. 
But there was too much images and most of the images name was too long. That's why git didn't allow me to commit those images. 

So, if you wanna train your own model download pictures of each person and seperate them in folders. 
And then import those folders into datasets folder
